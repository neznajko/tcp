  <!-- 22. The Dutch mathematician R.J. Stroeker remarked: -----
    Every beginning student of number theory surely must have --
    marveled at the miraculous fact that for each natural number 
    n the sum of the first n positive consecutive cubes is a ---
    perfect square. --------------------------------------------
       Furthermore, it is the square of the sum of the first n -
    positive integers! That is: --------------------------------

       1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3 = (1 + 2 + · · · + n)^2

       Usually this identity is proven by induction, but that --
    does not give much insight into why the result is true, nor 
    does it help much if we wanted to compute the left-hand side
    but didn’t already know this result. In this problem, you --
    will give a story proof of the identity. -------------------

    (a) Give a story proof of the identity: --------------------
    
       1 + 2 + ··· + n = C(n+1,2)

    (b) Give a story proof of the identity: --------------------

       1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3 = 6C(n+1,4) + 6C(n+1,3) + C(n+1,2)

       It is then just basic algebra (not required for this ----
    problem) to check that the square of the right-hand side in 
    (a) is the right-hand side in (b). ------------------------>
    
    <!-- Zo (a) is a special case of the Hokey Stick formula,
         C(n+1,k+1) = C(n,k) + C(n-1,k) + + + C(k,k), for k = 2,
         vhich ve interpreted last time, for (b) basically I
         have no clue, but nonetheless ve can prove the 
         miraculous formula as follows:
         We have blue and red teams each consisting of n 
         break dance vs popping players, zo we want to count
         the number of battels of 2 against 2, that is if n = 4
         we have red(1,2) vs blue(1,2), red(1,2) vs blue(1,3),
         etc. so we can write a table:
           
         R \ B (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4)                   
         (1,2)   -     -     -     -     -     -
         (1,3)   -     -     -     -     -     -
         (1,4)   -     -     -     -     -     - 
         (2,3)   -     -     -     _     _     _
         (2,4)   -     -     -     _     _     _ 
         (3,4)   -     -     -     _     _     _

         The number of all (i,j) pairs is C(n,2) = C(4,2) = 6,
         this is the height and the width of the table, and we
         want to split the number of all battles C(n,2)^2 =
         ( 1 + 2 + ... + n - 1 )^2 into cases where a fyorst
         player say the captain of a team is participating:)
         these are marked with -, the other cases _ there is no
         battles involving a captain( this guy is crazy! ), zo
         the number of - is the sum of three rectangles:
         the upper left where both captains are playing:
         A = (n - 1)^2
         the upper right where only the captain of the red team
         is playing:
         B = (n - 1)(C(n,2) - (n - 1))
         and the bottom left, where only the captain of the blue
         team is playing:
         C = B, zo the number of - is
         S = A + B + C = (n - 1)^2 + 2(n - 1)(C(n,2) - n + 1),
         C(n,2) = n!/2!(n - 2)! = n(n - 1)/2,
         S = (n - 1)^2 + (n - 1)(n(n - 1) - 2n + 2) =
           = (n - 1)( n - 1 + n^2 - n - 2n + 2 ) =
           = (n - 1)(n^2 - 2n + 1) = (n - 1)^3, with the same
         fashion we can continue with the _ rectangle which is
         consisiting only battles between n - 1 red and blue
         players that is the same problem with size n - 1,
         thus proving that:
         C(n,2)^2 = (n - 1)^3 + (n - 2)^3 + ... + 1          -->
